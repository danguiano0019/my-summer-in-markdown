# My Summer In Markdown

## Introduction

My name is Daniela Anguiano and I am currently a sophomore. I am taking three APs this year, including this class of Computer Science.

## Summer Activities

During the summer, I was in Bakersfield helping to take care of my sister's dogs and my nephew. I also went to downtown L.A. to go quince dress shopping for both me and cousin. I also did online classes over the summer, one being a college course. I also hung out with my friends throughout the summer, and went to Malibu with my cousins.

## Goals For The School Year

This school year, I hope to achieve and maintain a 4.0 GPA both semesters this year. I also hope to pass all of my AP classes and tests and hopefully score higher than a three on all of them as well. I also hope to balance my academics with my sports and personal life better this year compared to last year.

## Sports or Physical Activites

This summer unfortunately I was unable to practice or condition in any way. I had an ankle injury and was in physical therapy and working to recover my ankle throughout the summer.

## Expectations for the Class

My expectations for this class is to hopefully be able to focus more than last year and be able to maintain better study habits. I also want to be able to find a more beneficial way to remember vocabulary from all units. Another expectations for the class is to expand my knowledge from last year and learning new things.
